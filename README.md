### About Perceptual Extreme Super Resolution Network with Receptive Field Block

If you're new to RFB-ESRGAN, here's an abstract straight from the paper:

Perceptual Extreme Super-Resolution for single image is extremely difficult, because the texture details of 
different images vary greatly. To tackle this difficulty, we develop a super resolution network with 
receptive field block based on Enhanced SRGAN. We call our network RFB-ESRGAN. The key contributions are 
listed as follows. First, for the purpose of extracting multi-scale information and enhance the feature 
discriminability, we applied receptive field block (RFB) to super resolution. RFB has achieved competitive 
results in object detection and classification. Second, instead of using large convolution kernels in 
multi-scale receptive field block, several small kernels are used in RFB, which makes us be able to 
extract detailed features and reduce the computation complexity. Third, we alternately use different 
upsampling methods in the upsampling stage to reduce the high computation complexity and still remain 
satisfactory performance. Fourth, we use the ensemble of 10 models of different iteration to improve 
the robustness of model and reduce the noise introduced by each individual model. Our experimental results 
show the superior performance of RFB-ESRGAN. According to the preliminary results of 
NTIRE 2020 Perceptual Extreme Super-Resolution Challenge, our solution ranks first among all the participants.

### Model Description

We have two networks, G (Generator) and D (Discriminator).The Generator is a network for generating images. 
It receives a random noise z and generates images from this noise, which is called G(z).Discriminator is 
a discriminant network that discriminates whether an image is real. The input is x, x is a picture, 
and the output is D of x is the probability that x is a real picture, and if it's 1, it's 100% real, 
and if it's 0, it's not real.
